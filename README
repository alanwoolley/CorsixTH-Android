This is a port of CorsixTH (http://code.google.com/p/corsix-th) to Android.

You will need either a copy of the original Theme Hospital game or a demo of Theme Hospital in order to use this port. The demo is available at http://th.corsix.org/Demo.zip.

I've only tested it on my ZTE Blade running Android 2.3.7 and on the emulator, so your mileage may vary.

What's broken?

*	Music
*	CorsixTH doesn't support screen resolutions below 640x480 yet, so some of the UI will be obscured or fall off the display.
