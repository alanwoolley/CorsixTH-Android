This is a port of CorsixTH (https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH) to Android.

You will need either a copy of the original Theme Hospital game or a demo of Theme Hospital in order to use this port. The demo can be automatically downloaded from within the app.

HUGE thanks to everyone for their bug reports, feedback and suggestions.
