This is a port of CorsixTH (code.google.com/p/corsix-th) to Android.

You will need either a copy of the original Theme Hospital game or a demo of Theme Hospital in order to use this port. The demo is available at http://th.corsix.org/Demo.zip.

--------
Prerequisites
--------
- For now, you will require a phone with a screen resolution of at least 640x480.
- Android 2.2 (Froyo) or greater
- At least 25MB free on your mobile device
- Support for OpenGL ES version 1.x

--------
How to install
--------
1. 	Mount the phone/SD card on your computer.
2.	Create a directory called 'th' on the root of the SD Card (/sdcard/th).
3.	Copy your Theme Hospital Game/Demo files into here.
4.	Download and install the APK.
5.	Run



I've only tested it on my ZTE Blade running Android 2.3.7 and on the emulator, so your mileage may vary.

--------
What's broken?
	- Music
	- CorsixTH doesn't support screen resolutions below 640x480 yet, so some of the UI will be obscured or fall off the display.
