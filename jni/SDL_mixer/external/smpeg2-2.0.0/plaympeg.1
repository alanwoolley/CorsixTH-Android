.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplaympeg\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIfile ...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I plaympeg
is an MPEG audio and video player that uses the SDL MPEG Player Library.
It can play back MPEG audio (layer 1, 2 and 3), MPEG video (MPEG-1) and
MPEG system (audio and video combined) files. MPEG-2 video files (as found
on DVDs) are not supported.
.PP
The video player works best on a 16 bit color depth X11 display,
it works on other color depths with reduced speed as well. You'll need a
CPU with 300 MHz or more to play back an MPEG system stream with 25 frames
per second (fps) at full speed.
