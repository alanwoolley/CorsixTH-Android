mpegsound README.LIB(International)

MPEG/WAVE player library

This library have NO WARRANTY. You can use this under Library GPL.
This library uses part from vplay, maplay 1.2 for linux, maplay 1.2+ for Win95.

This is library which can make program play MPEG-1/2 audio and Wave file easily.
Detail is in ChangeLog

CAUTION
  The current implementation was tested with little endian architecture.
  Bigendian is implemented. But I don't test.
  Hackers... please help me!

  What's the difference?  
  For example;
   unsigned char a[4]={0x11,0x22,0x33,0x44};
   unsigned int *b=(unsigned int *)&a;

	Little endian (Intel) : 0x44332211
	Big    endian         : 0x11223344

   The classes 'mpegtoraw' and 'bitwindow' are endian dependent.

  OTHER ENDIAN PROBLEM
    Some machines can access integer type variables when they are aligned
  at 4-bytes. If endian problem is solved. It cause serious problem.

  I have exploited the linear properties of 2 and 3 dimensional arrays.
  like for example;

    int a[4][4];

    a[1][0]==a[0][4] is true.

  Of course, It may occur boundary problem. But it may make player faster!

IMPROVED
  Using mpg123 code, I improved performance of this library.
  Thank you for authors of mpg123

ENGLISH PROBLEM
  I release README with International (English) and Korean (my native lang)
The Korean version should be ok, but the english version have many spelling
mistakes and confusing words and sentences. Please forgive me and help me
correct the english.

PROBLEM?
  Please send me bug report or patches.(Please comment where is changed)
   to:
	jwj95@eve.kaist.ac.kr
	jwj95@nownuri.net

THANKS FOR this document.
