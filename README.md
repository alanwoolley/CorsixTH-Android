## Installing

CorsixTH requires the original Theme Hospital game files in order to play. If you do not own a version of Theme Hospital, then you can download the demo from within the app, or provide your own copy.

If you have bought the game from [gog.com](https://www.gog.com/en/game/theme_hospital) then you can download the installer on your device, or transfer it to your device, and select the option from the setup wizard that appears on first launch.

If you have a version of Theme Hospital from a different source, you will need to either copy the entire directory to your device, or make it available on a cloud storage provider. You can then import the files from the setup wizard.
